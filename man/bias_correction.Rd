\title{GEE Bias Correction testing 1, 2}
\usage{
bias_correction(nsim = 500, icc, v_overall, n_litters, pups_litter)
}
\arguments{
\item{nsim}{Number of simulations. Default is set to 500}

\item{icc}{Intra-class correlation coefficient for the litter effect (between 0.05 to 0.95 of the total variance)}

\item{v_overall}{total variance (litter + residual variance)}

\item{n_litters}{Number of litters in the study (or number of schools)}

\item{pups_litter}{Number observations per litter (or student from a given school)}
}
\description{
This function allows the user to determine the "correct" bias correction
for generalized estimating equations. The corrections are to ensure the
standard error of the estimates is not underestimated in small sample
situations. When uncorrected, GEE's can have error rates that exceed
nominal levels (alpha = 0.05).
It should also be noted that this function is for a specific design, that
has observations completely nested within a higher level unit. For example,
litter mates (rodents from same mother) are all categorized one way. In reference
to educational settings, this would be equivalent to entire schools receiving 
an intervention and the students were the observational units.
}
\details{
n_litters must be even. Returned value closest to pretermined alpha level should be used as correction
