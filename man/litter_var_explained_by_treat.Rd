\title{Between-litter variance explained by
the treatment effect}
\usage{
litter_var_explained_by_treat(outcome, treatment, litter)
}
\arguments{
\item{outcome}{the observations to be predicted}

\item{treatment}{predictor (two groups: high vs low LG)}

\item{litter}{litter variable (see my_data for example)}
}
\description{
This function computes the between_litter variance
explained by the treatment effect. Note that treatment
does not necessarily reflect and experimental design.
In this context, the treatment is a comparison between
two groups (e.g., high vs low lg).
}
\details{
Note that, in some instances, the variance explained
can be negative. In this case, there is more betweem-litter
variance after the inclusion of the treatment effect in the
model. This is cannot be interpreted directly, but does 
indicate that the treatment effect did not explain any
of the between-litter variance
