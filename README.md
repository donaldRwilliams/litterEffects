This package is specifically for the research design discussed in the paper Between-litter variation in developmental studies of hormones and behavior: inflated false positives and diminished power. This 
consists of two-groups in which entire litters are catergorized the same way. For example, in the
natural variations in maternal care literature, rat pups from same litter are categorized as
low or high LG (licking and grooming).
