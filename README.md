This package is specifically for the research design discussed in the paper Between-litter variation in developmental studies of hormones and behavior: inflated false positives and diminished power.

*Note*. Many research areas—for example, natural variation in maternal care and prenatal stress—categorize entire litters based on maternal behavior or experimental condition. For example, litter mates from High-LG/Prenatal Stress and Low-LG/Prenatal Control dams are coded the same way. When groups are compared (0 vs. 1), unaccounted for between-litter variation (i.e., dependent measures) violates the statistical assumption of independence. Use of a *t*-test would be incorrect for this research design. This package provides methods to address this issue.
